Here is a fcitx5 chinese input method dict table of modifiled chanjie, with my slection of another zhuyin table(inspired form Hsu's zhuyin keyboard).
As an chinese computer user,always I typing chinese characters with chanji,but somethimes I need zhuyin method to find some words form the voice memories.
Therefore I decided to combinded those two methods(chanjie & zhuyin),choosing of the Hsu's zhuyin keyboad would be nicely fitting the keyboard layout and usual habits of mine.
